(this page applies to ecs-sync 3.1+) ## Quick Start

To quickly start using the ecs-sync UI, load the home page in a browser
(``https://{vm_ip}``). The default login is ``admin/ecs-sync``. On first
login, type in an alert email address (if you won't use scheduling or
alerts, this doesn't have to be real). Then click **Save & Write
Configuration to Storage**. That's it! The UI is now ready to use.
